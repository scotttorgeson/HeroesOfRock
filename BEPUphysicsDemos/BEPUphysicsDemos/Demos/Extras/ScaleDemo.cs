            //There are two reasons: 
            //1) Limited numerical precision in 32 bit floats. There are far fewer discrete values between 100,000 and 100,001 than there are between 10 and 11.
            //This manifests most noticeably in general case collision detection.
            //2) Numerical tolerances that are not adjusted by the ConfigurationHelper.ApplyScale method below.
            //These other tolerances are defined as constants in the engine as they aren't usually the limiting factor, but you can still
            //go into the source code and change them if you want.  The most used ones are the Epsilon and BigEpsilon in the Toolbox class.
            //Some other systems have custom epsilons as well, though they are typically far smaller.
            //Note that extremely large scales can force various epsilon-reliant systems to do more work than necessary, resulting in slightly lower performance.

            //a whole lot.  Once the configuration is set properly, most of any remaining 'unsmoothness' in the simulation is due to a lack of temporal resolution; 
            //one discrete step can take an object from a valid state to an unpleasing state due to the high rates of motion.  
            //To simulate the same amount of time with a smaller time step duration requires taking more time steps.
            //This is a quality-performance tradeoff.  If you want to do this, set the time step duration like so:

            //Space.TimeStepSettings.TimeStepDuration = 1 / 120f;

            //And then, in the update, either call the Space.Update() method proportionally more often or use the Space.Update(dt) version, which takes as many timesteps are necessary to simulate dt time.

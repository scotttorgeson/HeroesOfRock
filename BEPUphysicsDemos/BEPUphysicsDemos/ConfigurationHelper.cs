    /// This class contains a bunch of helper functions to set up the simulation for different goals.
    /// Try using some of the different profiles in the simulations to see the results.
    /// You can also play with the numbers in the profiles to see the results.
    /// 
    /// One configuration option that these functions do not take advantage of is changing the time step.
    /// By default, the Space.TimeStepSettings.TimeStepDuration is set to 1/60f.  This is pretty good for most simulations.
    /// However, sometimes, you may need to drop the rate down to 1/30f for performance reasons.  This harms the simulation quality quite a bit.
    /// On the other hand, the update rate can be increased to 1/120f or more, which vastly increases the simulation quality.
    /// 
    /// When using a non-60hz update rate it's a good idea to pass the elapsed gametime into the Space.Update method (you can find
    /// the demos's space update call in the Demo.cs Update function).  This will allow the engine to take as many timesteps are 
    /// necessary to keep up with passing time.  Just remember that if the simulation gets too hectic and the engine falls behind,
    /// performance will suffer a lot as it takes multiple expensive steps in a single frame trying to catch up.  In addition,
    /// since the number of time steps per frame isn't fixed when using internal time stepping, subtle unsmooth motion may creep in.
    /// This can be addressed by using the interpolation buffers.  Check out the Updating Asynchronously documentation for more information.
    /// [Asynchronous updating isn't needed to use internal time stepping, it's just a common use case.]
